# Effects-of-Inclusion-in-Hierarchical-Caches
Description:
The word inclusion with reference to the hierarchical caches means, the content of lower level
caches should be present at the higher level of caches. Enforcing inclusion in hierarchical caches
means that under all circumstances this property should be preserved. In this project, I have
modified Simple Scalar simulator code to enforce the inclusion property and performed a comparative
study of results ( cache hit rate / miss rate ) for before inclusion and after inclusion of the
property in the Simple Scalar Simulator. The result shows the increase of miss rate in L1 and L2 caches. 
Further, I have shown that cache miss-rate reduces with the increase of cache size and set associativity.
